As he grew older, he began to realize that he didn't know who he was or what he wanted out of life. He felt lost and confused, unsure of his place in the world.

One day, while out on a hike with his friends, Alex stumbled upon a hidden cave deep in the woods. He couldn't resist the urge to explore, and he ventured inside.

As he made his way deeper into the cave, he saw a faint light in the distance. As he got closer, he saw that it was a small pond, and in the middle of the pond was an old man.

The old man looked at him and said, "Welcome, young one. I have been waiting for you."
